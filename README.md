# Safe and Reliable AI via Guardrails

## Introduction

Welcome to my working repository for the "Safe and Reliable AI via Guardrails" course. This repository contains all the labs and exercises I practiced during the course. 

To run the course exercises locally on my MacBook Pro M1, I installed [Ollama](https://ollama.ai/) and successfully set up the Llama 3.1 model, which works smoothly on my machine. For integrating Guardrails with the Llama 3.1 model, I utilised `litellm`, as Guardrails supports this framework.
